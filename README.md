## 🚀 Introduction

## 📝 Requirements

The exercise consists on developing a ** Burguer single page**using the following **elements**:

- **Html**
- **Css**
- **JavaScript**

The page contains the following sections:

##🛠️ Technical requirements -**The website is fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes - Made with Flexbox and CSS Grid. -**Made transition with CSS -\*\*The css must is written in BEM

- The navigation menu is functional (opening and closing in mobile and tablet)

##🏗️ Building Process
I started reading the requirement and understood what I had to do, I continued to do the HTML structure and then I built the files in JavaScript, images and styles, and lastly I added a normalize extention to help the browsers suport with the styles I added.

##🧐What I've learned - **To fully combine HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript into a project - **To work with empty arrays, as well as pushing and storing data in them - **To practice BEM - **To practice CSS transitions to improve the user's experience

##🤯Some Issues
The construction the functional menu, and carrusel, took me a bit more time because I needed to read the documentation about how to make that.
